# HRIP-article-SI
This is the repository to share supporting information of python codes for reviewers. <br>
The models described in this repository can
- predcit numerous polymer'S refractive index at D line ($n_{D}$) from smaller-data-trained predictive model<br>
- provide specific structures optimized for  miltiple property (e.g. $n_{D}$ and $\Delta\varepsilon_{HOMO-LUMO}$ via generative approach)
# What we provide here
- codes
- data
- other nesisities (license etc. )

# Requirements
* Python (>3.10)
* PyTorch==2.2.0+cu118
* Numpy==1.26.4
* DGL==2.4.0+cu118
* networkx==3.5
* rdkit==2025.9.3
* botorch==0.16.1
* statsmodels==0.14.5

# Quick start of Molecule search through MOBO on Google Colab
1. Upload 
```
MOBO_with_original_nD_predictor_and_GPU-assisted_DFT.ipynb
```
2. Connect to a session with GPU (T4 is enough)
3. Install requirements <br>

```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Place two pickle files of $n_{D}$ predictor on \content or directory where currently you are
5. Run the code from scratch
6. You will see generated molecules as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System, )
7. Download result csv file if you need
