# HRIP-article-SI
This is the repository to share supporting information of python codes for reviewers. <br>
The models described in this repository can
- predcit numerous polymer'S refractive index at D line ($n_{D}$) from smaller-data-trained predictive model<br>
- provide specific structures optimized for  miltiple property (e.g. $n_{D}$ and $\Delta\varepsilon_{HOMO-LUMO}$ via generative approach)
# What we provide here
- codes
- data
- other nesisities (license etc. )
